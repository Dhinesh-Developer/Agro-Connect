                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>At AgriConnect, our mission is to empower rural farmers with a digital platform that connects them to markets, resources, and educational content. We aim to improve their livelihoods by providing tools that enhance their productivity and market reach.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>Enhancing Accessibility</h3>
                <p>We understand that many rural farmers might face challenges with digital literacy. To address this, we've implemented several features to make AgriConnect accessible to everyone:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simplified User Interface:</strong> Our platform features large icons, simple language, and minimal text to ensure it's intuitive even for those with limited literacy. Voice-assisted navigation is available in multiple regional languages to help users interact with the platform using spoken instructions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Offline Access:</strong> Farmers can access certain features offline, allowing them to prepare listings or view educational content without continuous internet connectivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assisted Access Points:</strong> We have set up village-level digital hubs with trained personnel to assist farmers in using the platform. Additionally, we partner with local NGOs to provide hands-on training and support.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile App with IVR:</strong> Our mobile app uses Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to let farmers interact with the platform via voice commands, making it easier to list products, check prices, and access services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration with Existing Channels:</strong> AgriConnect integrates with WhatsApp for updates and transactions and provides SMS alerts and commands for easy interaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Training Programs:</strong> We conduct workshops and train local peer educators to teach farmers how to use the platform. Step-by-step tutorials in local languages are also available.</li>
                </ul>
